Endpoint Security Groups
What are ESGs?

• Endpoint Security Groups (ESG) are a new network security component in 

Cisco ACI
• Introduced in ACI 5.0(1) and greatly enhanced in 5.2(1)

• Simplify configuration by decoupling network and security

• Security boundaries are no longer limited to a single BD/EPG association

• No complex configurations for shared service (VRF route leaking)



Classic EPGs still exist but the goal is to 
manage securities only via ESGs

Endpoint Security Groups
Considerations and Benefits

• Security policy now spans BDs (within one VRF)

• Simpler and more flexible than traditional EPGs (no more tight coupling to BD)



Endpoint Security Groups
Simple and Flexible Security

• Network Centric

• One subnet is one Security Group

What if we need a more granular 
security policy ?

Considerations and Benefits

• Security policy now spans BDs (within one VRF)

• Simpler and more flexible than traditional EPGs (no more tight coupling to BD)

• More efficient use of TCAM resources

• EPG is still used to bind VLANs and interfaces

• No changes in VRF/BD/EPG from network perspective

• ESG contracts and BD subnets are deployed on all nodes where the VRF is deployed

• Route leaking moves up to the VRF level

• No more need for subnets under a provider EPG

• No longer applied via a contract relationship

• Much simpler and intuitive route leaking config

ESG Selectors

Associating EP to ESGs



ESG Selectors
Supported Selectors 

• Selectors are configured under each ESG with a variety of matching criteria 

to classify endpoints to the ESG.

• Four selectors available:

• IP Subnet Selector – From release 5.0(1)

• Tag Selector – From release 5.2(1)

• EPG Selector – From release 5.2(1)

• Service EPG Selector – From 5.2(4) *





IP Subnet Selector



ESG Selectors
IP Subnet Selector

• Classifies endpoints to an ESG 

based on IP address
• Works with both host IP (/32 or /128) 

and subnet (any mask length)

• Only classifies IP address of endpoints

• Hence, only routed traffic is classified

There are workarounds to avoid that 
L2 traffic bypasses ESG classification

More on this later...



Tag Selector



ESG Selectors
Tag Selector

• Uses policy tags to classify 
endpoints to a given ESG
• A policy tag consists of a key and a 

value

• Policy tags can be assigned to a 

variety of user configurable objects

Each object can be matched by only 
one tag selector at a time.



To be part of this ESG, an 
EP just needs to match 
one of these selectors

ESG Selectors
What are Policy Tags?

• Policy Tags are objects (tagTag) that can be attached to ACI configurable 

objects as a label on which APIC can apply some effects

• As of 5.2(1), the following objects are supported for ESG Tag Selectors to 

match based on policy tags:

Type

Description

BD subnet

A subnet configured under a BD

IP address

A metadata to represent an IP address in a VRF

MAC address

A metadata to represent a MAC address in a BD

Object Class

fvSubnet

fvEpIpTag

fvEpMacTag
fvEpVmmMacTagDef



Static endpoint

A static endpoint configured under EPGs. Only type silent hosts 
are supported for ESG tag selector matching.

fvStCEp



ESG Selectors
Policy Tags Configuration

Static Endpoint

“Policy Tags” are 
configured under 
these objects

BD Subnet

Policy tags (tagTag) and annotations 
(tagAnnotation) are different

Endpoint Tag (MAC/IP)

Policy tags are not specific for ESGs, 
but only used by ESGs for now



ESG Selectors
Policy Tag Support for ESG

• How do you want to classify your endpoints?

• With a range of IPs:

• Policy tags on BD subnets

• With specific IPs:

• Policy tags on Endpoint IP Tags

• With specific MACs:

• Policy tags on Endpoint MAC tags

• With VMware VM attributes:

• Policy tags on VMM Endpoint MAC tags

• With existing static endpoints:

• Policy tags on existing static endpoints

ESG classification using VMware VM 
attributes requires VMM integration

Read-only VMM domain not supported. 
Enhancement being tracked

EPG Selector



ESG Selectors
EPG Selector

• An EPG selector matches an 

entire EPG to an ESG
• Multiple EPGs can be matched to an 

ESG using EPG selectors

• EPGs must be in the same tenant and 

the same VRF as the ESG

EPG Selectors play a critical role in the 
migration process! 



ESG Selectors

• Why are EPG Selectors so special?

• Because existing contracts under the EPG are inherited by the ESG

EPG Selector

• Why are EPG Selectors so special?

• Because existing contracts under the EPG are inherited by the ESG

• Guidelines:

• Multiple EPGs can be mapped to the same ESG

• EPGs must belong to the same tenant as the ESG

• EPGs must belong to the same VRF as the ESG

• No ‘after-the-fact’ security config changes on EPGs matched to an ESG:

• Contracts*

• Preferred Group Membership*

• Intra-EPG Isolations*



* Those can of course be configured on the ESG

Design Considerations
MAC-based Selectors vs IP-based Selectors

• MAC-Based Selectors

• Tag Selector (Endpoint MAC Tag)

• Tag Selector (Static Endpoint)

• Tag Selector (VMM Endpoint MAC Tag)

• IP-Based Selectors

• Tag Selector (Endpoint IP Tag)

• Tag Selector (BD Subnet)

• IP Subnet Selector

• Others

• EPG Selector



Recommended to use MAC-Based selectors 
whenever possible, as they are considered for both 
switched and routed traffic

Design Considerations
L2-Traffic Limitation for IP-Based Selectors

• Scenario 1:

• Scenario 3:

• MAC_A is matched by a selector of ESG 1

•

IP_A is _not_ matched by any ESG

• MAC_A is _not_ matched by any ESG

•

IP_A is matched by a selector of ESG 2

• Result:

• Result:

• Both MAC_A and IP_A are classified to ESG 1

• MAC_A is _not_ classified to any ESG, and still 

belongs to the original EPG

•

IP_A is classified to ESG 2

• Scenario 2:

• MAC_A is matched by a selector of ESG 1

•

IP_A is matched by a selector of ESG 2

• Result:

• MAC_A is classified to ESG 1

•

IP_A is classified to ESG 2



When only IP-based selectors are used, 
MAC addresses are not classified to ESGs. 

Design Considerations
L2-Traffic Limitation for IP-Based Selectors

• What’s the impact?

• Switching traffic (i.e., within the same subnet) do not use ESG contracts

• Even if its payload has the IP address classified to an ESG.

• In other words...

• Two IP Endpoints (same subnet, same EPG) are classified to different ESGs

• These two endpoints can still talk freely through the MAC and its original EPG

IP Subnet Selector

This caveat is present with the following selectors and tags:
•
• Policy Tag Selector + BD Subnet Policy Tag
• Policy Tag Selector + Endpoint IP Tag



Design Considerations
L2-Traffic Limitation for IP-Based Selectors

• How to fix this?

• Use Proxy ARP (on all original EPGS)

• Proxy ARP makes sure that all traffic from the EPGs will be handled as a routing traffic. 

• This means that all traffic uses the pcTag of IP. It does no longer matter whether the MAC still 

belongs to the original EPG.

• How to enable Proxy ARP?

• Enable Intra-EPG Isolation + Enable Proxy-ARP

• Configure Intra-EPG Contract

• Allow Micro-segmentation for VMM integration

• Enable Flood in Encapsulation



The option use depends on 
the use case. 

More information in ESG PIW

Design Considerations
L2-Traffic Limitation for IP-Based Selectors

• What is the impact of enabling proxy ARP?

• Increase CPU usage due to increase in ARP requests being processed

• ARP requests are punted to CPU, hence being rate-limited by CoPP

• This may impact if several ARP resolution are triggered at the same time

• e.g., after a leaf reboot



Design Considerations
VRF, BD or EPG in Common

• What if my design uses the tenant common?

• This may limit the selectors that you can use

Note when VRF and/or BD are in 
common, you are also able to match 
endpoints from other tenants using 
the same VRF and BD

How can we provide 
some level of visibility and 
segmentation here?



Migration Scenario
How a typical fabric looks like

• How does segmentation look like before?

• Typical options:

• Using Preferred Groups

• Using vzAny

Thanks to Preferred Groups, 
all EPGs can talk to each 
other with no restrictions

Migration Scenario
Choosing your Segmentation Level

• How much segmentation do we want?

• Single Security Zones per VRF

• Equivalent to Preferred Groups or vzAny

• Multiple Security Zones per VRF

• Think of this like having several Preferred Groups per VRF

• Segmentation per Application

• Segmentation per Application tier/service

• and more...

Step 1 – Single ESG for open communication

• Create a new catch-all ESG

• Use EPG selector to group all EPGs under a single ESG

•

Initially, all EPs will be mapped to it

• Progressively, only EP not matched with a more specific rule will remain here

Step 2 – Mapping EPs to applications

• How to map EP to application ESG?

• Using VMM Endpoint MAC Tags (i.e., vCenter Tags) 

Recommended

• Using Endpoint MAC Tags

• Using Endpoint IP Tags

• Using BD Subnet Tags *

• Using IP Subnet Selector *

* Although it’s possible, it may be unlikely that all endpoints for app are part of a subset of BD subnet.
Hence, using Endpoint IP Tag is typically a better option.

• How to map EP to application ESG?

• Using VMM Endpoint MAC Tags (i.e., vCenter Tags) 

• Using Endpoint MAC Tags

• Using Endpoint IP Tags

• Using BD Subnet Tags *

• Using IP Subnet Selector *

If planning to use IP-based selectors, remember 
to enable proxy-arp using intra-ESG contracts 
before starting the migration

It cannot be done after EPG selector is used

* Although it’s possible, it may be unlikely that all endpoints for app are part of a subset of BD subnet.
Hence, using Endpoint IP Tag is typically a better option.

Migration Scenario
Summary

• Use ESGs to apply your desired security policy

• Use EPGs just to configure forwarding

•

i.e., configure VLAN on a port to connect EPs to a given BD

• You can decide how much you want to segment in a flexible way

• Zone-based Segmentation

• Application-based Segmentation

• Micro-segmentation

• ... or your own way

• Mapping of Endpoints to ESG is done based on policy

• Hence, no need to move EPs to different port-groups or change the VLAN being used



FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions about ESGs



Frequently Asked Questions
ESG

• Can an EPG talk to an ESG if there is a contract between them?

• Generally, no, they can’t

• The only exception is when an ESG uses an EPG selector for migration purposes

• When an EPG is mapped to an ESG, the ESG inherits EPG contracts and hence can talk to EPGs 

based on existing contracts

• However, no new contracts can be added afterwards

ESG

• Can an EPG talk to an ESG if there is a contract between them?

• Generally no, they can’t

• The only exception is when an ESG uses an EPG selector for migration purposes

• When an EPG is mapped to an ESG, the ESG inherits EPG contracts and hence can talk to EPGs 

based on existing contracts

• However, no new contracts can be added afterwards

• Can ESGs be used for External Endpoints?
• No, only internal EPs can be mapped to ESGs

• External EPGs are still used for external destinations

• ESGs can talk to External EPGs as long as a contract exists between them

• Nothing changes here compared to EPGs



Frequently Asked Questions
ESG

• Can I use Service Graphs or PBR with ESGs?

• Yes, absolutely

• All Service Graph and PBR features supported for EPGs are supported for ESG except 

explicitly mentioned

• Can I use ESGs if I have Multi-Pod or Remote Leaf?

• Yes, ESG is supported with Multi-Pod, Multi-Tier and Remote Leaf

• Can I use ESGs if I have Multi-Site?
• No, ESG is not supported in Multi-Site yet

• Support is expected around 2HCY24



Frequently Asked Questions
ESG

• Can I use AND operations with ESG selectors?

• No, ESG selectors are always combined using OR operation

• In other words, only one of the selectors need to match for EP to be part of ESG

• What if I already have contracts between EPG?

• In that case, migrate away from EPG into ESG as follows:

1. Create one ESG per EPG you have (1:1 mapping)

2. Use EPG selector to map EPG to ESG

3. Replicate EPG contracts with ESGs (need new contracts)

4. Remove EPG contracts when done

• After that, you can evolve your ESG segmentation as you wish



Frequently Asked Questions
ESG

• Is ESG supported on Nexus Dashboard Insights?

• No, ESG is not supported in Insights yet

• Support will be added around 2HCY24
