I would like to align over the expectations of documentation and way of working for Ringfencing PoC:

•	A functional (end user) description of the ringfencing network building block as described in the ringfencing pattern. 
o	A solution design would be nice but is not strictly necessary.  
•	A user manual on how to make use of the ringfencing network building block. The user manual should tell us how to: 
o	Request a new ringfence and which options/choices we have. 
o	Move a system into the ringfence
o	Deploy a new system into the ringfence
o	Define the access to and from the system(s)
The goal of the description is to allow a team to determine if the ringfence is a suitable solution to mitigate certain types of risks, and what the benefits and limitations are. 
The goal of the user manual is to allow a team to migrate to a ringfenced network independency and efficiently. It should clearly describe the steps, required information and timelines. 

[26-02] Aligned, action points defined, documentation to be delivered
[13-03] Re-align to discuss the documentation provided (rescheduled due to illness)

what are the asks here?
